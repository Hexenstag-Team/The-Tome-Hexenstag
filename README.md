The Hexenstag Tome
=========

A Tome compilation PDF that is intended to eventually be complete enough
such that you can play an entire game without the player needing to rely
on external documents for character creation, gameplay, and character
advancement.

It seems inevitable that the GM may need to rely on external resources,
particularly when trying to find good monsters to place as opposition.
Still, a limited selection of monsters is probably going to be eventually
included in the project, probably as a separate PDF. Monsters are the
lowest priority though, since GMs can just look them up on websites.
SRD monsters, as well as other monsters that are compatible with the SRD
system should all be fine to use.

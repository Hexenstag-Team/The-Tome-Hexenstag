Of the various elven subraces, none are more notorious than the Drow. Descended from the original dark-skinned Elven subrace called the Ssri-tel-quessir, the Drow were cursed into their present appearance by the good Elven deities for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Also called Dark Elves, the Drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have blood-red eyes, although pale eyes (so pale as to be often mistaken for white) in shades of pale lilac, silver, pink, and blue are not unknown. They also tend to be smaller and thinner than most Faer√ªnian Elves. Most Drow on the surface are evil and worship Vhaeraun, but some outcasts and renegades have a more neutral attitude, and there are even groups of good Drow who worship Eilistraee or other deities not of the traditional Drow pantheon. Though divided by endless feuds and schisms, the Drow are united in one terrible desire: they seethe with a hatred for the surface Elves. By their way of reckoning, they proved themselves the superior race in the Fourth Crown War, and the fact that the Seldarine (and Corellon in particular) punished them for their success is a poison that churns in their hearts and minds eternally. They burn with hatred for the Seldarine and their coddled children, and want nothing more than to return to the surface and bring to the elves there suffering a thousand times greater than that which the drow have been forced to endure over the past ten thousand years.

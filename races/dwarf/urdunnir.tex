Urdunnirs, sometimes known as orecutter dwarves, are a longforgotten offshoot of shield dwarves who have become one with the earth and stone. Thanks to the blessings of Dumathoin, Urdunnirs can walk through earth and stone as if it were air and shape metal and stone with their hands. Many orecutter dwarves are clerics of Dumathoin, expert smiths, or expert gemcutters. The Children of Dumathoin, as they call themselves, believe that the Silent Keeper transformed their ancestors in order to create a race of dwarves who could appreciate the true beauty of the subterranean landscape without needing to destroy it in the process. They have dwelt ever since in splendid isolation in Oldonnar, the legendary Lost Kingdom of Shanatar, deep beneath the Alimir Mountains.

Something that isn't stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A Urdunnir who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a \linkskill{Search} check as if he were actively searching, and can use the \linkskill{Search} skill to find stonework traps; they can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.
\item Weapon Familiarity: Urdunnirs may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.
\item Stability: Urdunnir gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).

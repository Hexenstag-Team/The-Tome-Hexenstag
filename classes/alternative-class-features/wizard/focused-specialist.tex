\acfentry{Focused Specialist}

Every wizard who calls himself a specialist takes pride in wielding his preferred form of magic. Those who are exceptionally pure of purpose take this specialization to an entirely new level, disdaining breadth of skill in favor of even greater focus.

\textbf{Class:} Wizard

\textbf{Level:} 1st

\textbf{Changes:}

\begin{itemize*}
\item You lose one spell slot from each level of wizard spells you can cast. If you later gain the ability to cast higherlevel wizard spells, you lose one spell slot from each new level of spells you can cast.
\item You must also choose another prohibited school of magic, which can't be divination.
\item You can prepare two additional spells of your specialty school per spell level each day. These extra spells are in addition to those normally granted to a specialist wizard. This benefit doesn't apply to spells gained from classes other than wizard.
\end{itemize*}

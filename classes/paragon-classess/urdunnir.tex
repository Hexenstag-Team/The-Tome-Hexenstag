%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Urdunnirs see the world as a work of living beauty, walking through stone and earth much as a diver might explore the wonders of the ocean depths. The Children of Dumathoin regard themselves as particularly blessed, for they are not forced to cling to the exterior of Dumathoin’s creation like other races but can wander through the heart of the world itself in an endless search to uncover the Silent Keeper’s hidden secrets (gems).

\classfeatures

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} A Urdunnir gains no armor or weapon proficiencys.

\textbf{Stone Walk (Su):} Urdunnirs can pass through stone and earth as if it were air. They can carry up to twice their own body weight with them in this manner. Urdunnirs (and anyone carried with them) cannot breathe while within stone or earth and must hold their breath while traveling in this manner.

\textbf{\linkspell{Stone Shape} (Sp):} At will as an 8th-level sorcerer.

\textbf{\linkspell{Shape Metal} (Sp):} At will as an 8th-level sorcerer once per round. This power works just like the shape metal spell, except that urdunnirs can only affect 5 cubic feet of metal. Using this ability is a full-round action.

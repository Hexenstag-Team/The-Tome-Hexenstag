\classfeatures

\textbf{Weapon and Armor Proficiency:} \currentclassname{}s is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, as well as the racial weapons for their race. \currentclassname{}s is proficient with Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor in addition to Shields and Great Shields.

\textbf{Mercenary Maneuvers (Ex):} As a Mercenary gains class levels they learn how to perform amazing maneuvers of daring-do and general badassery which are collectively called "Maneuvers." A Maneuver takes a Standard Action. Many of the Mercenary's Stances specifically impact the Mercenary's special Mercenary Maneuvers, and that refers to these and not just any attack action or full attack they happen to make. A Mercenary has an Initiator level equal to their class level. A Mercenary learns one maneuver each odd-numbered Mercenary level, but they can also abandon any number of maneuvers they already learned whenever they gain a level of any class and learn new maneuvers that they qualify for. Most Mercenary Maneuvers allow the character to make a standard attack modified in some fashion. If they are using a double weapon with which they are proficient or two finesseable weapons, they may instead make one standard attack with each weapon (adding only half their Strength bonus to the off-hand weapon), but any special maneuver effects that trigger on damage only trigger once if either or both attacks hit.

\textbf{Secrets of Battle (Ex):} A Mercenary adds their Intelligence Modifier (if positive) to their attack rolls, up to a maximum bonus equal to their Mercenary Level.

\textbf{Stances (Ex):} While the Mercenary is not flatfooted, they may engage a Stance at the cost of one Swift Action per round. Each Stance is usually based on the unique fighting techniques of one of the world's armies that the Mercenary has trained in, fought with, or researched. Each Stance is procedurally generated, allowing the character to gain the benefit of their Intelligence bonus to something they don't normally get to do. Each Stance also needs a name, which can be generated on the chart at the end of this section.

\textbf{Basic Bonuses:}
\begin{itemize*}
\item Add Intelligence Modifier to weapon damage.
\item Add Intelligence Modifier to Armor Class.
\item Add Intelligence Modifier to Saving Throws.
\item Add Intelligence Modifier to Strength and Dexterity based Skill Checks.
\item Gain Spell Resistance of 5 + Level + Intelligence Modifier.
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Hardened Survivor (Ex):} A 2nd level Mercenary has resigned themselves to living in crappy conditions on both sides of a siege, and resigned themselves to eating things that a less martially oriented person would refuse out of hand. They may add their Constitution modifier to their \linkskill{Survival} checks instead of their Wisdom Modifier. They also add their \linkskill{Survival} ranks to the amount of negative health they can take before dying. (ie. 5 ranks in Survival means they die at -15 Hit Points)

\textbf{Wearing Shoes (Ex):} A 3rd level Mercenary understands how people thinks and what they find normal. The Mercenary gains a bonus to Disguise equal to their Intelligence Modifier, and suffers no penalty for disguising themselves as a different race.

\textbf{Lucky (Ex):} It's amazing how a lucky veteran keeps coming back from amazingly dangerous situations. A 4th level Mercenary gains a Luck bonus to their Saving Throws equal to their Constitution Modifier, to a maximum of their Class Level.

\textbf{Veteran's Experience (Ex):} A 5th level Mercenary has seen crazy crap and come out craftier for it. They gain an Enhancement bonus to their Intelligence equal to one third of their character level (round up).

\textbf{Leader of Men:} At 6th level, a Mercenary gains Command as a bonus feat. If they already have Command, they can take another [Leadership] Feat that they qualify for instead.

\textbf{Boots Keep Walking (Ex):} At level 7 and again at levels 9, 11, 13, 17 and 19 a Mercenary's experience fighting on the battlefields of the Heavy Metalish terrain that dots the landscape grants them special abilities related to that terrain experience. Every time the Mercenary gains one of these Terrain-based abilities they also gain a cumulative +1 bonus to all Survival tests as they are able to generalize their specific experiences into relevancies in other circumstances.

\textbf{Terrain Powers:}
\begin{description*}
\item[Cave Crawler:] The Mercenary suffers no penalty for squeezing. The Mercenary's movement speed is not reduced during poor visibility.
\item[Cliff Jumper:] The Mercenary gains a Climb Speed equal to half their land speed. The Mercenary ignores difficult terrain caused by uneven stone.
\item[Ice Skater:] The Mercenary gains Energy Resistance to Cold equal to their Character Level. They ignore the effects of any decreased temperatures.
\item[Inferno Commando:] The Mercenary gains Energy Resistance to Fire equal to their Character Level. They ignore the effects of any increased temperatures.
\item[Jungle Fighter:] The Mercenary can move through difficult terrain caused by vegetation as if it wasn't there, counts cover from vegetation as if it was one stage better in both directions (so 50\% cover would provide them a +6 AC bonus but only a +2 AC bonus to enemies), and does not take damage or get entangled from enchanted vegetation such as entangle or briar web.
\item[Planar Champion:] The Mercenary ignores Planar Traits that would suck for them such as "Lawfully Aligned" or "Prison Plane" - not the Gravity or Time traits.
\item[Swamp Beast:] The Mercenary is able to ignore difficult terrain that is caused by an area being water logged. Also they are immune to the nauseated condition.
\item[Waste Warrior:] The Mercenary takes twice as long to dehydrate and takes half damage from dessication effects. Also they take no damage from and their visibility is not impaired by dust storms, smoke clouds, ash rains, and any similar stuff.
\end{description*}

\textbf{Meet Interesting People (Ex):} At 10th level, the Mercenary add their Intelligence Modifier to Charisma skills; this does stacks with Wearing Shoes ability(ie. add Intelligence Modifier twice).

\textbf{Logistics Master (Ex):} A 14th level Mercenary is a master of War and can manage supply lines intuitively. The Mercenary can use their Survival skill to manage Logistics on any scale from the personal to the Imperial.

\textbf{Going Places (Sp):} A 15th level Mercenary can follow anything to anywhere. By touching something from another plane, they may \linkspell{Planeshift} to the plane of the creature or object's origin. Since it is easy to touch yourself, a Mercenary can always return to their own plane of origin. This can also be used to banish things to their home plane of existence, if they fail a Will Save.

\textbf{Mass Desertion (Ex):} An 18th level Mercenary is a dreaded thing. When he takes to the field, enemies know their cause is hopeless. Enemies of CR 8 or less who see the Mercenary in the fray simply give up. They retreat or surrender as appropriate. This is not a fear effect, and extends to line of sight.

Additionally, the general other-dimensional doom raining down pushes creatures over, negates ranged attacks, and impedes flight within 50' of the Mercenary until his next turn as per a Hurricane-Force Wind.

\subsubsection{Naming Your Stances}
%%%

When you name your styles, be sure to have the representative species name in there somewhere, and also generate an adjective and a noun to name the stance. The racial word can go in the first, second, or third position depending on what sounds better. So when making a Drow style, you could have the "Underhanded Grandeur of the Drow" or the "Drow Invincible Method" or the "Informal Drow Approach".

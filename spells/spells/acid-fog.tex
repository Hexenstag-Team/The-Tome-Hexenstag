Acid fog creates a billowing mass of misty vapors similar to that produced by a solid fog spell (page 281). In addition to slowing creatures down and obscuring sight, this spellâ€™s vapors are highly acidic. Each round on your turn, starting when you cast the spell, the fog deals 2d6 points of acid damage to each creature and object within it.

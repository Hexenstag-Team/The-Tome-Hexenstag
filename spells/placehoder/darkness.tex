This spell causes an object to radiate shadowy illumination out to a 20-foot radius. 
All creatures in the area gain concealment (20\% miss chance). Even creatures that 
can normally see in such conditions (such as with darkvision or low-light vision) 
have the miss chance in an area shrouded in magical \textit{darkness}.

Normal lights (torches, candles, lanterns, and so forth) are incapable of brightening 
the area, as are light spells of lower level. Higher level light spells are not 
affected by \textit{darkness}.

If \textit{darkness} is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under 
a lightproof covering, the spell's effect is blocked until the covering is removed.

\textit{Darkness} counters or dispels any light spell of equal or lower spell level.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A bit of bat fur and either a drop of pitch 
or a piece of coal.

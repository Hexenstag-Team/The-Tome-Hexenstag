The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings 
as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb 
in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet; furthermore, it need 
not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside 
down). A \textit{spider climbing} creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor 
Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks 
against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.

\textit{Material Component:} A drop of bitumen and a live spider, both of which 
must be eaten by the subject.

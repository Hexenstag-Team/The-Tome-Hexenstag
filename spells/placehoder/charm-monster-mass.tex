This spell functions like \linkspell{Charm Monster}, except that Mass Charm 
Monster affects a number of creatures whose combined HD do not exceed twice your 
level, or at least one creature regardless of HD. If there are more potential targets 
than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you choose a creature 
with too many HD.

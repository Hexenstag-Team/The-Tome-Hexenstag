\textit{Mind fog} produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental resistance 
of those caught in it. Creatures in the \textit{mind fog} take a -10 competence 
penalty on Wisdom checks and Will saves. (A creature that successfully saves against 
the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the 
fog.) Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and 
for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until 
dispersed by wind).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in four rounds; a strong wind (21+ 
mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The fog is thin and does not significantly hamper vision.

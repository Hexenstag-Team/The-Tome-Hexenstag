The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. 
The creature benefits from a 50\% miss chance as if it had total concealment. However, 
unlike actual total concealment, \textit{displacement} does not prevent enemies 
from targeting the creature normally. \textit{True seeing} reveals its true location.

\textit{Material Component:} A small strip of leather twisted into a loop.

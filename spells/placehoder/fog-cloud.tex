A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, 
including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks 
have a 20\% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50\% miss 
chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) 
disperses the fog in 1 round.

The spell does not function underwater.

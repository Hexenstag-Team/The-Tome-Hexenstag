\spellentry{Prying Eyes, Greater}\label{spell:Greater Prying Eyes}

Divination

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 8

This spell functions like \textit{prying eyes}, except that the eyes can see all 
things as they actually are, just as if they had \textit{true seeing} with a range 
of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at full normal speed. Also, 
a \textit{greater prying eye'}s maximum Spot modifier is +25 instead of +15.

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\textbf{Target:} One petrified creature or a cylinder of stone from 1 ft. to 3 
ft. in diameter and up to 10 ft. long

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude negates (object); see text

This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and 
goods. The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process. Any 
petrified creature, regardless of size, can be restored.

The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh 
is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is 
available. (For example, this spell would turn a stone golem into a flesh golem, 
but an ordinary statue would become a corpse.) You can affect an object that fits 
within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a 
cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.

\textit{Material Component:} A pinch of earth and a drop of blood.

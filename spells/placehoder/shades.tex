Illusion (Shadow)

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 9

This spell functions like \textit{shadow conjuration}, except that it mimics sorcerer 
and wizard conjuration spells of 8th level or lower. The illusory conjurations 
created deal four-fifths (80\%) damage to nonbelievers, and nondamaging effects 
are 80\% likely to work against nonbelievers.

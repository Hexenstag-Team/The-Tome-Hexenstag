This spell grants the caster the ability to make one ray attack per round. The 
ray dazes one living creature, clouding its mind so that it takes no action for 
1d3 rounds. The creature is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage 
against it), but it can't move, cast spells, use mental abilities, and so on.

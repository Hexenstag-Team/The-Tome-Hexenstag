You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal 
or other harder materials. The passage is 10 feet deep plus an additional 5 feet 
deep per three caster levels above 9th (15 feet at 12th, 20 feet at 15th, and a 
maximum of 25 feet deep at 18th level). If the wall's thickness is more than the 
depth of the passage created, then a single \textit{passwall} simply makes a niche 
or short tunnel. Several \textit{passwall} spells can then form a continuing passage 
to breach very thick walls. When \textit{passwall} ends, creatures within the passage 
are ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispels the \textit{passwall} or you 
dismiss it, creatures in the passage are ejected out the far exit, if there is 
one, or out the sole exit if there is only one.

\textit{Material Component:} A pinch of sesame seeds.

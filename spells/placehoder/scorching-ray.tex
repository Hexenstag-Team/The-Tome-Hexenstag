You blast your enemies with fiery rays. You may fire one ray, plus one additional 
ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). 
Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage.

The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all bolts must be aimed 
at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.

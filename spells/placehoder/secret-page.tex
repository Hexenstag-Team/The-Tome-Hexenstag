S\textit{ecret page} alters the contents of a page so that they appear to be something 
entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show even another spell. 
\textit{Explosive runes} or \textit{sepia snake sigil} can be cast upon the \textit{secret 
page}.

A \textit{comprehend languages} spell alone cannot reveal a \textit{secret page'}s 
contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. 
You can then peruse the actual page, and return it to its \textit{secret page} form 
at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. 
A \textit{detect magic} spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does 
not reveal its true contents. T\textit{rue seeing} reveals the presence of the 
hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with 
\textit{comprehend languages}. A \textit{secret page} spell can be dispelled, and 
the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an \textit{erase} spell.

\textit{Material Component:} Powdered herring scales and will-o'-wisp essence.

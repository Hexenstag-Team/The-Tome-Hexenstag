\textit{Shield} creates an invisible, tower shield-sized mobile disk of force that 
hovers in front of you. It negates \textit{magic missile} attacks directed at you. 
The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal 
touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The \textit{shield} has no armor check 
penalty or arcane spell failure chance. Unlike with a normal tower shield, you 
can't use the \textit{shield} spell for cover.

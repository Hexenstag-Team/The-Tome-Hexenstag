\spellentry{Symbol of Insanity}

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Clr 8, Sor/Wiz 8

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates

This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that all creatures within 
the radius of the \textit{symbol of insanity} instead become permanently insane 
(as the \textit{insanity} spell).

Unlike \textit{symbol of death}, symbol of insanity has no hit point limit; once 
triggered, a \textit{symbol of insanity} simply remains active for 10 minutes per 
caster level.

\textit{Note:} Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of insanity} are hard to detect 
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a \textit{symbol of 
insanity} and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, 
or 33 for \textit{symbol of insanity}.

\textit{Material Component:} Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and 
opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp.

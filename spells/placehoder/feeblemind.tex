\spellentry{Feeblemind}

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 5

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\textbf{Target:} One creature

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates; see text

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

If the target creature fails a Will saving throw, its Intelligence and Charisma 
scores each drop to 1. The affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or 
Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. 
Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. 
The subject remains in this state until a \textit{heal}, \textit{limited wish}, 
\textit{miracle}, or \textit{wish} spell is used to cancel the effect of the \textit{feeblemind}. 
A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a 
-4 penalty on its saving throw.

\textit{Material Component:} A handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres.

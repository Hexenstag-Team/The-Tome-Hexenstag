This spell summons a natural creature. It appears where you designate and acts 
immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. 
If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack 
particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

A summoned monster cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creature, nor can 
it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Creatures cannot be summoned 
into an environment that cannot support them.

The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list on the accompanying 
Summon Nature's Ally table. You choose which kind of creature to summon, and you 
can change that choice each time you cast the spell. All the creatures on the table 
are neutral unless otherwise noted.

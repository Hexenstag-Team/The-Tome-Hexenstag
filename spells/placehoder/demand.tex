\spellentry{Demand}

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 8

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will partial

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

This spell functions like \textit{sending}, but the message can also contain a 
\textit{suggestion} (see the \textit{suggestion} spell), which the subject does 
its best to carry out. A successful Will save negates the \textit{suggestion} effect 
but not the contact itself. The \textit{demand}, if received, is understood even 
if the subject's Intelligence score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible 
or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the 
time the \textit{demand} is issued, the message is understood but the \textit{suggestion 
}is ineffective.

The \textit{demand'}s message to the creature must be twenty-five words or less, 
including the \textit{suggestion}. The creature can also give a short reply immediately.

\textit{Material Component:} A short piece of copper wire and some small part of 
the subject -- a hair, a bit of nail, or the like.

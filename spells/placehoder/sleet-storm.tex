Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes the ground 
in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet 
at half normal speed with a DC 10 Balance check. Failure means it can't move in 
that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Balance skill for 
details).

The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A pinch of dust and a few drops of water.

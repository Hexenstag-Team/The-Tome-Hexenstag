\textit{Mending} repairs small breaks or tears in objects (but not warps, such 
as might be caused by a \textit{warp wood} spell). It will weld broken metallic 
objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing 
but one break exists.

Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be 
as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over 
by \textit{mending}. The spell can repair a magic item, but the item's magical 
abilities are not restored. The spell cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or 
wands, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).

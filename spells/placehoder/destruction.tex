\spellentry{Destruction}

Necromancy [Death]

\textbf{Level:} Clr 7, Death 7

\textbf{Components:} V, S, F

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

\textbf{Target:} One creature

\textbf{Duration:} Instantaneous

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude partial

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

This spell instantly slays the subject and consumes its remains (but not its equipment 
and possessions) utterly. If the target's Fortitude saving throw succeeds, it instead 
takes 10d6 points of damage. The only way to restore life to a character who has 
failed to save against this spell is to use \textit{true resurrection}, a carefully 
worded \textit{wish} spell followed by \textit{resurrection}, or \textit{miracle}.

\textit{Focus:} A special holy (or unholy) symbol of silver marked with verses 
of anathema (cost 500 gp).

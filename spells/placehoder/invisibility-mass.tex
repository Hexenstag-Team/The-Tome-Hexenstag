This spell functions like \textit{invisibility}, except that the effect is mobile 
with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in the 
group cannot see each other. The spell is broken for any individual who moves more 
than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group. (If only two individuals are 
affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both 
are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between 
them exceeds 180 feet.)

\textit{Material Component:} An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.

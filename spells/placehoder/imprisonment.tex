When you cast \textit{imprisonment} and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state 
of suspended animation (see the \textit{temporal stasis} spell) in a small sphere 
far beneath the surface of the earth. The subject remains there unless a \textit{freedom 
}spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search 
by a \textit{crystal ball}, a \textit{locate object} spell, or some other similar 
divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but \textit{discern 
location} does. A \textit{wish} or \textit{miracle} spell will not free the recipient, 
but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts 
about its life, the target takes a -4 penalty on its save.

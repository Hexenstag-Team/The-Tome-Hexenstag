\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

This spell causes those within the area to turn on each other rather than attack 
their foes. Each affected creature has a 50\% chance to attack the nearest target 
each round. (Roll to determine each creature's behavior every round at the beginning 
of its turn.) A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act 
normally for that round.

Creatures forced by a \textit{song of discord} to attack their fellows employ all 
methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous 
combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen unconscious.

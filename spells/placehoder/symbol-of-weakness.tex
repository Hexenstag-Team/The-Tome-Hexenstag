\spellentry{Symbol of Weakness}

Necromancy

\textbf{Level:} Clr 7, Sor/Wiz 7

This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that every creature 
within 60 feet of a \textit{symbol of weakness} instead suffers crippling weakness 
that deals 3d6 points of Strength damage.

Unlike \textit{symbol of death}, \textit{symbol of weakness} has no hit point limit; 
once triggered, a \textit{symbol of weakness} simply remains active for 10 minutes 
per caster level.

\textit{Note:} Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of weakness} are hard to detect 
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a \textit{symbol of 
weakness} and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, 
or 32 for \textit{symbol of weakness}.

\textit{Material Component:} Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and 
opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp.

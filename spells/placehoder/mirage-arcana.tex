This spell functions like \textit{hallucinatory terrain}, except that it enables 
you to make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes 
audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike \textit{hallucinatory 
terrain}, the spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none 
are present). Still, it can't disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures 
within the area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide 
themselves within a real location).

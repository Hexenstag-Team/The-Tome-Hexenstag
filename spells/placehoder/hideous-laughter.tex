This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into 
gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, 
but is not considered helpless. After the spell ends, it can act normally.

A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature 
whose type is different from the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, 
because humor doesn't "translate" well.

\textit{Material Component:} Tiny tarts that are thrown at the target and a feather 
that is waved in the air.

You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each 
round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth 
as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 
10 minutes, forcing the subject to leave.

On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the 
\textit{maze} spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the 
subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature 
within a plane, such as \textit{teleport} and \textit{dimension door}, do not help 
a creature escape a \textit{maze} spell, although a \textit{plane shift} spell 
allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are 
not affected by this spell.

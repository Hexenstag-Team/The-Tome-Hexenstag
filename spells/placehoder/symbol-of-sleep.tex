\spellentry{Symbol of Sleep}

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Clr 5, Sor/Wiz 5

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates

This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that all creatures of 
10 HD or less within 60 feet of the \textit{symbol of sleep} instead fall into 
a catatonic slumber for 3d6x10 minutes. Unlike with the \textit{sleep} spell, sleeping 
creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.

Unlike \textit{symbol of death}, \textit{symbol of sleep} has no hit point limit; 
once triggered, a \textit{symbol of sleep} simply remains active for 10 minutes 
per caster level.

\textit{Note:} Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of sleep} are hard to detect 
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a \textit{symbol of 
sleep} and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, 
or 30 for \textit{symbol of sleep}.

\textit{Material Component:} Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and 
opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp.

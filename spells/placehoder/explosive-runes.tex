You trace these mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing 
written information. The \textit{runes} detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points 
of force damage. Anyone next to the \textit{runes} (close enough to read them) 
takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of 
the \textit{runes} is entitled to a Reflex save for half damage. The object on 
which the \textit{runes} were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).

You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing 
without triggering the \textit{runes}. Likewise, you can remove the \textit{runes 
}whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful \textit{dispel 
magic} or \textit{erase} spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the \textit{runes 
}and failing to do so triggers the explosion.

\textit{Note:} Magic traps such as \textit{explosive runes} are hard to detect 
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the \textit{runes 
}and Disable Device to thwart them. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 
28 for \textit{explosive runes}.

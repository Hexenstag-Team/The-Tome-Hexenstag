The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your choice -- highly nourishing, 
if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible within 24 hours, although 
it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting a \textit{purify food and 
water} spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water, 
and it doesn't go bad as the food does.

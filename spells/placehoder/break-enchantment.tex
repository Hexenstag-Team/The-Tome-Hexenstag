This spell frees victims from enchantments, transmutations, and curses. Break 
Enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you 
make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 
+ caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, 
curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25.

If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by \linkspell{Dispel Magic}, break 
enchantment works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. 

If the effect comes from some permanent magic item Break Enchantment does 
not remove the curse from the item, but it does frees the victim from the item's 
effects.

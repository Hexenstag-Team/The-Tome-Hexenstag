\textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level

This spell functions like \textit{fog cloud}, but in addition to obscuring sight, 
the \textit{solid fog} is so thick that any creature attempting to move through 
it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes 
a -2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective 
ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object 
that falls into \textit{solid fog} is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that 
it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can't take a 5-foot 
step while in \textit{solid fog}.

However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, 
and it does so in 1 round.

\textit{Solid fog} can be made permanent with a \textit{permanency} spell. A permanent 
\textit{solid fog} dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

\textit{Material Component:} A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered 
animal hoof.

You forge a telepathic bond among yourself and a number of willing creatures, each 
of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. Each creature included 
in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically 
through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established 
as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although 
not from one plane to another).

If desired, you may leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision 
must be made at the time of casting.

\textit{Telepathic bond} can be made permanent with a \textit{permanency} spell, 
though it only bonds two creatures per casting of \textit{permanency}.

\textit{Material Component:} Pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures.

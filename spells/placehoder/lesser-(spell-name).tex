\spellentry{Lesser (Spell Name)}

Any spell whose name begins with \textit{lesser} is alphabetized in this chapter 
according to the second word of the spell name. Thus, the description of a \textit{lesser 
}spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based. Spell chains 
that have \textit{lesser} spells in them include those based on the spells \textit{confusion, 
geas, globe of invulnerability, planar ally, planar binding}, and \textit{restoration}.

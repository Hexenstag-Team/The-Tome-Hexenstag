\textit{Heal} enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away 
injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse 
conditions affecting the Target: ability damage, blinded, \textit{confused}, dazed, 
dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, \textit{feebleminded}, insanity, 
nauseated, sickened, stunned, and poisoned. It also cures 10 hit points of damage 
per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.

\textit{Heal} does not remove negative levels, restore permanently drained levels, 
or restore permanently drained ability score points.

If used against an undead creature, \textit{heal} instead acts like \textit{harm}.

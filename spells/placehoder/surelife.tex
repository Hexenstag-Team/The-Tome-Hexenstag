This spell allows the caster to protect him or herself against some condition that 
would ordinarily cause certain death. The character can only protect him or herself 
against a natural occurrence or condition, not against a spell or the action of 
a creature. The character must specify the condition against which he or she wishes 
to protect him or herself, and the spell is effective only against that condition. 
Should the character be subjected to that condition during the duration of the 
spell, he or she feels no discomfort and takes no damage from the condition. However, 
the spell does not protect any items carried on the caster's person. At the end 
of the spell's duration, the condition has full normal effects if the character 
is still subjected to it.

\spellentry{Teleport, Greater}\label{spell:Greater Teleport}

Conjuration (Teleportation)

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 7, Travel 7

This spell functions like \textit{teleport}, except that there is no range limit 
and there is no chance you arrive off target. In addition, you need not have seen 
the destination, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description 
of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient 
information (or with misleading information), you disappear and simply reappear 
in your original location. Interplanar travel is not possible.

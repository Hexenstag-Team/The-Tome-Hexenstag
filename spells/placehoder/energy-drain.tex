\spellentry{Energy Drain}

Necromancy

\textbf{Level:} Clr 9, Sor/Wiz 9

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Fortitude partial; see text for \textit{enervation}

This spell functions like \textit{enervation}, except that the creature struck 
gains 2d4 negative levels, and the negative levels last longer.

There is no saving throw to avoid gaining the negative levels, but 24 hours after 
gaining them, the subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = \textit{energy 
drain} spell's save DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative 
level is removed. If it fails, the negative level also goes away, but one of the 
subject's character levels is permanently drained.

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 2d4x5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

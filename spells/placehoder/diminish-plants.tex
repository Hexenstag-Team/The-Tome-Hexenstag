This spell has two versions.

\textit{Prune Growth:} This version causes normal vegetation within long range 
(400 feet + 40 feet per level) to shrink to about one-third of their normal size, 
becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been 
carefully pruned and trimmed.

At your option, the area can be a 100- foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, 
or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle.

You may also designate portions of the area that are not affected.

\textit{Stunt Growth:} This version targets normal plants within a range of 1/2 
mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year 
to one third below normal.

\textit{Diminish plants} counters \textit{plant growth}.

This spell has no effect on plant creatures.

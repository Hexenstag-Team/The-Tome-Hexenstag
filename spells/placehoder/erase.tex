\textit{Erase} removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll 
or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, 
you can remove \textit{explosive runes}, a \textit{glyph of warding}, a \textit{sepia 
snake sigil}, or an \textit{arcane mark}, but not \textit{illusory script} or a 
\textit{symbol} spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch 
it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing 
is 90\%.

Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster 
level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. (A natural 1 or 2 is always a 
failure on this check.) If you fail to erase \textit{explosive runes}, a \textit{glyph 
of warding}, or a \textit{sepia snake sigil}, you accidentally activate that writing 
instead.

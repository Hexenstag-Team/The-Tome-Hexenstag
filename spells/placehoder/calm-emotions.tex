This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected creatures, 
but Calm Emotions can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones 
from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they 
can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against 
or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed 
creatures.

This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted 
by spells such as \linkspell{Bless}, \linkspell{Good Hope}, and \linkspell{Rage}, as well as negating 
a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability. It also suppresses 
any fear effects and removes the \linkcondition{Confused} condition from all targets. 
While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect. When the Calm 
Emotions spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, 
provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

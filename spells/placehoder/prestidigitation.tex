Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once 
cast, a \textit{prestidigitation} spell enables you to perform simple magical effects 
for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation 
can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot 
cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It 
cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. \textit{Prestidigitation 
}can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created 
by a \textit{prestidigitation} spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be 
used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a \textit{prestidigitation 
}lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an 
object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

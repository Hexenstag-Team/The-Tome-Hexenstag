You sense the direction of a well-known or clearly visualized object. You can search 
for general items, in which case you locate the nearest one of its kind if more 
than one is within range. Attempting to find a certain item requires a specific 
and accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the actual object, 
the spell fails. You cannot specify a unique item unless you have observed that 
particular item firsthand (not through divination).

The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead. Creatures cannot be found by 
this spell. \textit{Polymorph any object} fools it.

\textit{Arcane Focus:} A forked twig.

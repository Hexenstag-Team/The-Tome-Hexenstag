\textbf{Level:} Clr 5, Pal 4

\textbf{Components:} V, S, DF

\textbf{Duration:} Permanent; see text

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

You draw an indelible mark on the subject and state some behavior on the part of 
the subject that will activate the mark. When activated, the mark curses the subject. 
Typically, you designate some sort of criminal behavior that activates the mark, 
but you can pick any act you please. The effect of the mark is identical with the 
effect of \textit{bestow curse}.

Since this spell takes 10 minutes to cast and involves writing on the target, you 
can cast it only on a creature that is willing or restrained.

Like the effect of \textit{bestow curse}, a \textit{mark of justice} cannot be 
dispelled, but it can be removed with a \textit{break enchantment}, \textit{limited 
wish}, \textit{miracle}, \textit{remove curse}, or \textit{wish} spell. \textit{Remove 
curse} works only if its caster level is equal to or higher than your \textit{mark 
of justice} caster level. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the mark 
has activated.

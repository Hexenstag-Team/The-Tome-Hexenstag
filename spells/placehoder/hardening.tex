This spell increases the hardness of materials.  For every two caster levels, increase 
by 1 the hardness of the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase 
improves only the material's resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by 
the improvement.

The \textit{hardening} spell does not in any way affect resistance to other forms 
of transformation. 

This spell affects up to 10 cubic feet per level of the spellcaster.

If cast upon a metal or mineral, the volume is reduced to 1 cubic foot per level.

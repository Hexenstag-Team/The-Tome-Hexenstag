This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. (This adjustment is treated 
as an enhancement bonus.) There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as 
burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this 
spell affects your jumping distance (see the Jump skill).

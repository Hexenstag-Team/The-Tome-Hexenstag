The caster creates a nonmagical, unattended object of any sort of matter. Items 
created are permanent and cannot be negated by dispelling magics or negating powers. 
For all intents and purposes, these items are completely real. The volume of the 
item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. The caster must succeed 
at an appropriate skill check to make a complex item.

Unlike the items brought into being by the lower-level spells \textit{minor creation 
}and \textit{major creatio}n, objects created by the casting of \textit{true creation 
}can be used as material components.

\textit{XP Cost:} The item's gold piece value in XP, or a minimum of 1 XP, whichever 
is more.

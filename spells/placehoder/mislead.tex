You become invisible (as \textit{improved invisibility}, a glamer), and at the 
same time, an illusory double of you (as \textit{major image}, a figment) appears. 
You are then free to go elsewhere while your double moves away. The double appears 
within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration 
beginning on the first round after the casting). You can make the figment appear 
superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image 
appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different 
directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were 
real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.

The illusory double lasts as long as you concentrate upon it, plus 3 additional 
rounds. After you cease concentration, the illusory double continues to carry out 
the same activity until the duration expires. The \textit{improved invisibility 
}lasts for 1 round per level, regardless of concentration.

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} 10 ft.

An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you and excludes all spell 
effects of 3rd level or lower. The area or effect of any such spells does not include 
the area of the \textit{lesser globe of invulnerability}. Such spells fail to affect 
any target located within the globe. Excluded effects include spell-like abilities 
and spells or spell-like effects from items. However, any type of spell can be 
cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not 
affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. 
The globe can be brought down by a targeted \textit{dispel magic} spell, but not 
by an area \textit{dispel magic}. You can leave and return to the globe without 
penalty.

Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, 
and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled. 

If a given spell has more than one level depending on which character class is 
casting it, use the level appropriate to the caster to determine whether \textit{lesser 
globe of invulnerability} stops it.

\textit{Material Component:} A glass or crystal bead that shatters at the expiration 
of the spell.

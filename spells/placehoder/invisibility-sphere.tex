\spellentry{Invisibility Sphere}

Illusion (Glamer)

\textbf{Level:} Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M

\textbf{Area:} 10-ft.-radius emanation around the creature or object touched

This spell functions like \textit{invisibility}, except that this spell confers 
invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center of 
the effect is mobile with the recipient.

Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected 
by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but 
creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. 
Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility 
only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the \textit{invisibility sphere 
}ends.

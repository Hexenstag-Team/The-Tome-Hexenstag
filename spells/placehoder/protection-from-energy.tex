\textit{Protection from energy} grants temporary immunity to the type of energy 
you specify when you cast it (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). When the 
spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of energy damage (to a maximum of 120 
points at 10th level), it is discharged.

\textit{Note: Protection from energy} overlaps (and does not stack with) \textit{resist 
energy}. If a character is warded by \textit{protection from energy} and \textit{resist 
energy}, the \textit{protection} spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.

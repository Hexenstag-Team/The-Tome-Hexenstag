\spellentry{Overland Flight}

Transmutation

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 5

\textbf{Components:} V, S

\textbf{Range:} Personal

\textbf{Target:} You

\textbf{Duration:} 1 hour/level

This spell functions like a \textit{fly} spell, except you can fly at a speed of 
40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy 
load) with average maneuverability. When using this spell for long-distance movement, 
you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution 
checks). This means you can cover 64 miles in an eight-hour period of flight (or 
48 miles at a speed of 30 feet).

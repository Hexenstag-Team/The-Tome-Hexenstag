This spell functions like \textit{summon nature's ally I}, except that you can 
summon one 9th-level creature, 1d3 8th-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 
lower-level creatures of the same kind.

When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, 
lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.

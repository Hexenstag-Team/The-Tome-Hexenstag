A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small 
enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject 
for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except 
from a \textit{rod of cancellation}, a rod \textit{of negation}, a \textit{disintegrate 
}spell, or a targeted \textit{dispel magic} spell. These effects destroy the sphere 
without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, 
though the subject can breathe normally.

The subject may struggle, but the sphere cannot be physically moved either by people 
outside it or by the struggles of those within.

\textit{Material Component:} A hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching 
hemispherical piece of gum arabic.

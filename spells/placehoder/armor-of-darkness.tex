recipient a +3 deflection bonus to Armor Class plus an additional +1 for every 
four caster levels (maximum bonus +8). The subject can see through the armor as 
if it did not exist and is also afforded darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Finally, 
the subject gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against any holy, good, or light 
spells or effects.Undead creatures that are subjects of armor of darkness 
also gain +4 turn resistance.

\spellentry{Crushing Hand}

Evocation [Force]

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 9, Strength 9

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M, F/DF

This spell functions like \textit{interposing hand}, except that the hand can interpose 
itself, push, or crush one opponent that you select.

The \textit{crushing hand} can grapple an opponent like \textit{grasping hand} does. 
Its grapple bonus equals your caster level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma 
modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively), +12 for the hand's 
Strength score (35), +4 for being Large. The hand deals 2d6+12 points of damage 
(lethal, not nonlethal) on each successful grapple check against an opponent.

The \textit{crushing hand} can also interpose itself as \textit{interposing hand 
}does, or it can bull rush an opponent as \textit{forceful hand} does, but at a 
+18 bonus.

Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

Clerics who cast this spell name it for their deities.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} The shell of an egg.

\textit{Arcane Focus:} A glove of snakeskin.

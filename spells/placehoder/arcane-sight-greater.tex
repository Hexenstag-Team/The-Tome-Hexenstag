\spellentry{Arcane Sight, Greater}

Divination

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 7

This spell functions like \textit{arcane sight}, except that you automatically 
know which spells or magical effects are active upon any individual or object you 
see.

\textit{Greater arcane sight} doesn't let you identify magic items.

Unlike Arcane Sight, this spell cannot be made permanent with a \linkspell{Permanency} spell.

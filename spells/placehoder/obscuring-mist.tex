A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures 
all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment 
(attacks have a 20\% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment 
(50\% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a \textit{gust of wind} spell, disperses 
the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A \textit{fireball, 
flame strike}, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's 
area. A \textit{wall of fire} burns away the fog in the area into which it deals 
damage.

This spell does not function underwater.

\spellentry{Greater (Spell Name)}

Any spell whose name begins with \textit{greater} is alphabetized in this chapter 
according to the second word of the spell name. Thus, the description of a \textit{greater 
}spell appears near the description of the spell on which it is based. Spell chains 
that have \textit{greater} spells in them include those based on the spells \textit{arcane 
sight, command, dispel magic, glyph of warding, invisibility, magic fang, magic 
weapon, planar ally, planar binding, prying eyes, restoration, scrying, shadow 
conjuration, shadow evocation, shout}, and \textit{teleport}.

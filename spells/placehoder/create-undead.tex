A much more potent spell than \textit{animate dead}, this evil spell allows you 
to create more powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs. The 
type or types of undead you can create is based on your caster level, as shown 
on the table below.

\begin{description*}
\item[Caster Level 11th or Lower] Ghoul
\item[12th to 14th] Ghast
\item[15th to 17th] Mummy
\item[18th or Higher] Mohrg
\end{description*}

You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. 
Created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you 
are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature 
as it forms.

This spell must be cast at night.

\textit{Material Component:} A clay pot filled with grave dirt and another filled 
with brackish water. The spell must be cast on a dead body. You must place a black 
onyx gem worth at least 50 gp per HD of the undead to be created into the mouth 
or eye socket of each corpse. The magic of the spell turns these gems into worthless 
shells.

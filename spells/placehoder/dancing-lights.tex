Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns 
or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light 
(which look like will-o'-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. 
The \textit{dancing lights} must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation 
to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward 
or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move 
up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it 
exceeds the spell's range.

\textit{Dancing lights} can be made permanent with a \textit{permanency} spell.

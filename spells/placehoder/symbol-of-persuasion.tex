Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Clr 6, Sor/Wiz 6

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates

This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that all creatures within 
the radius of a \textit{symbol of persuasion} instead become \textit{charmed} by 
the caster (as the \textit{charm monster} spell) for 1 hour per caster level.

Unlike \textit{symbol of death}, \textit{symbol of persuasion} has no hit point 
limit; once triggered, a \textit{symbol of persuasion} simply remains active for 
10 minutes per caster level.

\textit{Note:} Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of persuasion} are hard to detect 
and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a \textit{symbol of 
persuasion} and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell 
level, or 31 for \textit{symbol of persuasion}.

\textit{Material Component:} Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and 
opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp.

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells 
such as \textit{clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object}, and \textit{detect 
}spells. \textit{Nondetection} also prevents location by such magic items as \textit{crystal 
ball}s. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster 
of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against 
a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast \textit{nondetection}. 
If you cast \textit{nondetection} on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, 
the DC is 15 + your caster level.

If cast on a creature, \textit{nondetection} wards the creature's gear as well 
as the creature itself.

\textit{Material Component:} A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.

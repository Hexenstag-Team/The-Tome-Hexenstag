Acid Fog creates a billowing mass of misty vapors similar to that produced 
by a \linkspell{Solid Fog} spell. In addition to slowing creatures down and obscuring 
sight, this spell's vapors are highly acidic. Each round on your turn, starting 
when you cast the spell, the fog deals 2d6 points of acid damage to each creature 
and object within it.

\textit{Arcane Material Component:} A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with 
powdered animal hoof.

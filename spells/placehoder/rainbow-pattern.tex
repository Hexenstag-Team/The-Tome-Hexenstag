A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates those within 
it. \textit{Rainbow pattern} fascinates a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. 
Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, 
those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. An affected 
creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern.

With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up 
to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). All fascinated creatures 
follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect. 
Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try 
to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area each fascinated 
creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked creatures 
who can't see them are no longer affected.

The spell does not affect sightless creatures.

this spell, but a bard must sing, play music, or recite a rhyme as a verbal component.

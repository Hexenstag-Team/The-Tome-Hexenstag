This spell causes instant diminution of a humanoid creature, halving its height, 
length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This decrease changes the creature's 
size category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, 
a -2 size penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on attack rolls 
and AC due to its reduced size.

A Small humanoid creature whose size decreases to Tiny has a space of 2-1/2 feet 
and a natural reach of 0 feet (meaning that it must enter an opponent's square 
to attack). A Large humanoid creature whose size decreases to Medium has a space 
of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet. This spell doesn't change the target's 
speed.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell.

Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. Other magical properties are not 
affected by this spell. Any \textit{reduced} item that leaves the \textit{reduced 
}creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns 
to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage (projectiles 
deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them).

Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack.

\textit{Reduce person} counters and dispels \textit{enlarge person}.

\textit{Reduce person} can be made permanent with a \textit{permanency} spell.

\textit{Material Component:} A pinch of powdered iron.

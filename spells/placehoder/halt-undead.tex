Necromancy

\textbf{Level:} Sor/Wiz 3

\textbf{Components:} V, S, M

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

30 ft. apart

\textbf{Duration:} 1 round/level

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Will negates (see text)

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent 
undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the 
spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of 
the spell (similar to the effect of \textit{hold person} on a living creature). 
The effect is broken if the \textit{halted} creatures are attacked or take damage.

\textit{Material Component:} A pinch of sulfur and powdered garlic.

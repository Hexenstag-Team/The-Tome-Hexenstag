\spellentry{Geas/Quest}\label{spell:Geas}\label{spell:Quest}

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]

\textbf{Level:} Brd 6, Clr 6, Sor/Wiz 6

\textbf{Casting Time:} 10 minutes

\textbf{Target:} One living creature

\textbf{Saving Throw:} None

This spell functions similarly to \textit{lesser geas}, except that it affects 
a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.

Instead of taking penalties to ability scores (as with \textit{lesser geas}), the 
subject takes 3d6 points of damage each day it does not attempt to follow the \textit{geas/quest}. 
Additionally, each day it must make a Fortitude saving throw or become sickened. 
These effects end 24 hours after the creature attempts to resume the \textit{geas/ 
quest}.

A \textit{remove curse} spell ends a \textit{geas/quest} spell only if its caster 
level is at least two higher than your caster level. \textit{Break enchantment 
}does not end a \textit{geas/quest}, but \textit{limited wish}, \textit{miracle}, 
and \textit{wish} do.

Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as \textit{geas}, while 
clerics call the same spell \textit{quest}.

\spellentry{Blade Barrier}

Evocation [Force]

\textbf{Level:} Clr 6, Good 6, War 6

\textbf{Components:} V, S

\textbf{Casting Time:} 1 standard action

\textbf{Range:} Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

\textbf{Effect:} Wall of whirling blades up to 20 ft. long/ level, or a ringed 
wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5 ft. per two levels; either form 
20 ft. high

\textbf{Duration:} 1 min./level (D)

\textbf{Saving Throw:} Reflex half or Reflex negates; see text

\textbf{Spell Resistance:} Yes

An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into 
existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per 
caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage.

If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature 
takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall 
(ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful 
Reflex save.

A Blade Barrier provides cover (+4 bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) 
against attacks made through it.

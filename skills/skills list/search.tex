\textbf{Action:} It takes a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side.

The spells \linkspell{Explosive Runes}, \linkspell{Fire Trap}, \linkspell{Glyph of Warding}, \linkspell{Symbol of Death}{Symbol} (all of them), and \linkspell{Teleportation Circle} create magic traps thata rogue can find by making a successful Search check and then can attempt to disarm by using Disable Device. Identifying the location of a \linkspell{Snare} spell has a DC of 23. \linkspell{Spike Growth} and \linkspell{Spike Stones} create magic traps that can be found using Search, but against which \linkskill{Disable Device} checksdo not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.

Active abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for 24 hours or more create barely visible energy fluctuations. These fluctuations give you a +4 bonus on Search checks to locate such abjuration spells.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in Search, you get a +2 bonus on \linkskill{Survival} checks to find or follow tracks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Knowledge} (architecture and engineering), you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to find secret doors or hidden compartments.

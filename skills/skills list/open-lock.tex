Attempting an Open Lock check without a set of thieves' tools imposes a -2 circumstance penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is employed. If you use masterwork thieves' tools, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.

\textbf{Check:} The DC for opening a lock varies from 20 to 40, depending on the quality of the lock, as given on the table below.

\textbf{Action:} Opening a lock is a full-round action.

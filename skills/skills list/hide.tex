\textbf{Check:} Your Hide check is opposed by the \linkskill{Spot} check of anyone who might see you. The table below gives the DCs modifiers for hide.

\begin{multicolsbasictable}{l c l c}

\textbf{Light} & \textbf{Hide DC Modifier} &\textbf{Size} & \textbf{Hide DC Modifier}\\
\textsuperscript{1}Shadowy & +0 & Fine & +16\\

\multicolumn{4}{p{14cm}}{\cellcolor{white}\textsuperscript{1} If the person has Darkvision or Low-Light Vision treat Shadowy light as Bright light for Hide checks}\\
\multicolumn{4}{p{14cm}}{\textsuperscript{2} If the person has Darkvision treat Darkness as Bright light for Hide checks}\\
\end{multicolsbasictable}

\textbf{Attacking:} If you've already hidden and you're at least 10 feet from your target, you can make a ranged attack, and then immediately hide again. You'll take a -10 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot (As Attacking on Table Above).

\textbf{Action:} Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn't take a separate action, unless done after an attack which is a move action.

\textbf{Special:} If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you're moving.

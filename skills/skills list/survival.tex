\textbf{Check:} You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild. The table below gives the DCs for various tasks that require Survival checks.

\begin{multicolsbasictable}{c l}

\textbf{Survival DC} & \textbf{Task}\\
10 & \multicolumn{1}{p{14cm}}{\raggedright{}Get along in the wild. Move up to one-half your overland speed while hunting and foraging (no food or water supplies needed). You can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which your check result exceeds 10.}\\
15 & \multicolumn{1}{p{14cm}}{\raggedright{}Gain a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving up to one-half your overland speed, or gain a +4 bonus if you remain stationary. You may grant the same bonus to one other character for every 1 point by which your Survival check result exceeds 15.}\\
15 & \multicolumn{1}{p{14cm}}{\raggedright{}Keep from getting lost or avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand.}\\
15 & \multicolumn{1}{p{14cm}}{\raggedright{}Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance. For every 5 points by which your Survival check result exceeds 15, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance.}\\
Varies & Follow tracks (see the \linkfeat{Track} feat).\\
\end{multicolsbasictable}

\textbf{Action:} Varies. A single Survival check may represent activity over the course of hours or a full day. A Survival check made to find tracks is at least a full-round action, and it may take even longer.

\textbf{Try Again:} Varies. For getting along in the wild or for gaining the Fortitude save bonus noted in the table above, you make a Survival check once every 24 hours. The result of that check applies until the next check is made. To avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards, you make a Survival check whenever the situation calls for one. Retries to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural hazard are not allowed. For finding tracks, you can retry a failed check after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes(indoors) of searching.

\textbf{Restriction:} While anyone can use Survival to find tracks (regardless of the DC), or to follow tracks when the DC for the task is 10 or lower, only a ranger (or a character with the Track feat) can use Survival to follow tracks when the task has a higher DC.

\textbf{Special:} If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you can automatically determine where true north lies in relation to yourself.

\textbf{Synergy:} If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on \linkskill{Knowledge} (nature) checks.

If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Knowledge} (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while underground.

If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Knowledge} (nature), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, forest, hill, marsh, mountains, and plains).

If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Knowledge} (geography), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.

If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Knowledge} (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks made while on other planes.

If you have 5 or more ranks in \linkskill{Search}, you get a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find or follow tracks.

\section{Skills Summary}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A characterâ€™s skills represent a variety of abilities. As a character advances in level, they gets better at using some or all of their skills.

\subsection{Getting Skills:}

If you buy a class skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on checks  with that skill) for each skill point. If you buy other classes' skills (cross-class  skills), you get 1/2 rank per skill point.

Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character level + 3.

Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do not round up or down).

\begin{multicolsbasictable}{c*{2}{c}}

To make a skill check, roll:\\
1d20 + skill modifier\\
(Skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier\\
+ miscellaneous modifiers)\\
\end{multicolsbasictable}

This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw -- the higher the roll, the better. Either you're trying to match or exceed a certain Difficulty Class (DC), or you're trying to beat another character's check result.

\textbf{Skill Ranks:} A character's number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making an untrained skill check.

\textbf{Ability Modifier:} The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the skill's key ability (the ability associated with the skill's use). The key ability of each skill is noted in its description.

\textbf{Miscellaneous Modifiers:} Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses,  armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.

Each skill point you spend on a skill gets you 1 rank in that skill. Class skills are the skills found on your character's class skill list. Cross-class skills are skills not found on your character's class skill list. You can't save skill points to spend later.

The maximum rank in a class skill is the character's level + 3. If it's a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is half of that number (do not round up or down).

Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any of your classes, your maximum rank equals your total  character level + 3.

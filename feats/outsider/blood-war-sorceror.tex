{Blood War Squaddie, Caster level 5, must have fought in the Blood war for one year.}
{Each time one of your spells successfully damages a creature with Spell Resistance, they take a cumulative -1 penalty to SR. This penalty is reduced by 5 for every day of rest, and can be otherwise healed as ability damage. In addition, you may cast any spell that requires you to be of a fiendish race.}

{You retain your memories perfectly after you are slain and brought back from the dead.}
{Must be a native to the Prime Material Plane}
{When you die and are returned back from the dead by any means, you do not lose a level, any XP, or Constitution. Any other penalties associated with returning to life (such as being exhausted or waking up in a new body) are unchanged. Note that this means that you have flawless intelligence as to the alignment of whoever brought you back from the dead.}

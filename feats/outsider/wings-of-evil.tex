\featentry{Wings of Evil} {[Fiend]}
\descfeat
{You have sinister bat-like wings growing from your back.}
{Character level 5.}
{You have a fly speed double that of your normal ground speed. You have good maneuverability, and you must be able to flap your wings to stay aloft (meaning that it requires very specialized armor or cloaks to permit flight).}
{If you would prefer to have insectile wings or feathered wings instead, you can do that. The maneuverability and speed are unchanged. Once the look and feel of the wings is selected it cannot be changed.}

\section{[Regional] Feats}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A [Regional] feat is a feat that represents a special, exclusive capability or talent found among the people of a particular place, ethnicity, or other specialized grouping. Each regional feat specifies one or more character race and region combinations as prerequisites.

When you choose a home region during character creation, you can select one [Regional] feat from the list available to characters of your homeland at 1st level only, but you can never have more than one regional feat. [Regional] feats are not bonus feats, you must use normal feat slots to select them, unless you chose one of your races favorite class in which case it is considered a bonus feat.

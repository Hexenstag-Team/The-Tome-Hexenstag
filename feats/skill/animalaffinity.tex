{You're one of those people animals just won't leave alone for no apparent reason.}
{Handle Animal ranks:}
{You gain the wild empathy ability, with your check equal to your character level plus your Charisma modifier plus any other applicable bonuses. If you already have wild empathy, or later gain it from another source, you gain a +3 bonus on Handle Animal checks.}
{You can handle an animal as a free action, and push it as a move action.}
{You gain the benefits of \linkspell{speak with animals} permanently as an extraordinary ability. The DCs for you to rear and train creatures are halved.}
{With a DC 30 Handle Animal check, you can use a mass version of \linkspell{charm animal} as a spell-like ability, with save DC equal to 10 + half your character level + your Cha modifier and effective caster level equal to your bonus on Handle Animal checks.}
{You can summon animals to your aid. Choose an animal with a CR equal to or less than your character level, and make a Handle Animal check at a DC of 25 + your character level. If you succeed, you summon a number of animals depending on how much the animal's CR is less than your character level for an hour. You can't use this ability again until any animals you've summoned with it have unsummoned or you've dismissed them.

{You feel at home no matter where you are.}
{Survival ranks:}
{You can follow tracks using Survival, See Rank 0 below.}
{You can identify the race/kind of creatures from their tracks.}
{You can move through or over difficult natural terrain without being slowed, taking nonlethal damage, or suffering other impairment. You take no penalties for moving your speed when tracking, and only -10 when moving double your speed. You can track subjects protected by \linkspell{pass without trace} or similar spells at a -20 penalty.}
{You can track through the Astral Plane with a DC 35 Survival check. You can determine the destination of a teleportation spell when standing at the point of departure with a DC 40 Survival check; if you have \linkspell{teleport} or a similar spell, you can follow as if you had seen the destination once.}
{You're immune to natural planar effects as if you had \linkspell{planar tolerance} always active.}

\textbf{Rank 0:} To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful 
\linkskill{Survival} check. You must make another Survival check every time the tracks become difficult to follow.

You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a -5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a -20 penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing conditions, as given on the table below:

\begin{multicolsbasictable}{l c l c}

\textbf{Surface} & \textbf{DC} & \textbf{Surface} & \textbf{DC}\\
Very soft ground & 5 & Firm ground & 15\\
Soft ground & 10 & Hard ground & 20\\
\end{multicolsbasictable}

\textit{Very Soft Ground:} Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.

\textit{Soft Ground:} Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow footprints.

\textit{Firm Ground:} Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces (broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or partial footprints.

\textit{Hard Ground:} Any surface that doesn't hold footprints at all, such as bare rock or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles). 

Several modifiers may apply to the Survival check, as given on the table below.

If you fail a Survival check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.

This feat does not allow you to find or follow the tracks made by a subject of a \linkspell{Pass Without Trace} spell.

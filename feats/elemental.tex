A feat with the [Elemental] tag can only be taken by a creature who is from an inner plane or any Elemental or Outsider with
an elemental subtype. If the feat has another similar tag (such as [Celestial], [Fey], or [Fiend]), a creature who fulfills the criteria for
the other tag may waive this requirement. The abilities granted by feats with the [Elemental] tag are Extraordinary abilities unless
otherwise stated.

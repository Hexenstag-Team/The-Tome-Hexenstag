\featentry{Tireless}{[Regional]}

You don’t know the meaning of the word “quit.”

\textbf{Benefit:} You reduce the effects of exhaustion and fatigue by one step. You cannot become exhausted. If you are exposed to an effect or condition that would normally make you exhausted (such as the spell \linkspell{Waves of Exhaustion}), you become fatigued instead. If an effect or condition (such as the end of barbarian rage) would normally make you fatigued, that effect is negated.

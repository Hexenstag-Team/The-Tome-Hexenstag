Youâ€™re an expert at using weapons in a grapple.

\textbf{Benefit:} You can use a light weapon to attack your opponent in a grapple with no penalty on the attack roll. In addition, you need not win a grapple check to draw a light weapon while grappling, although you still must use a move action to do so. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you can make a full attack with a light weapon while grappling, provided that you already have your weapon drawn.

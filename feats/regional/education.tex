\featentry{Education}{[Regional]}

You hail from a land where the pen is held in higher regard than the sword. In your youth, you received the benefi t of formal schooling of some type.

\textbf{Benefit:} All \linkskill{Knowledge} skills are class skills for your current and all your future classes. You may also select two \linkskill{Knowledge} skills to develop more fully. You get a +2 bonus on all checks you make with those skills. If you select a \linkskill{Knowledge} skill in which you do not yet have ranks, you gain no immediate benefi t, since \linkskill{Knowledge} skills can be used only with training. But the selection still represents your improved potential for that skill.

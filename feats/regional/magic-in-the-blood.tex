\featentry{Magic in the Blood}{[Regional]}

You have a knack for getting the most out of your innate magical abilities. You can use them more often than others of your race can.

\textbf{Benefit:} You can use your racial spell-like abilities more often than you otherwise could. Any ability that is otherwise usable once per day is now usable three times per day.

\featentry{Arcane Schooling}{[Regional]}

In your homeland, all who show some skill at the Art may receive training as arcane spellcasters. Thus, many characters know something of the ways of the bard, the sorcerer, or the wizard.

\textbf{Benefit:}Choose one arcane spellcasting class (bard, sorcerer, or wizard). You can activate spell trigger magic items as if you had 1 level in the selected class. The selected class also becomes a favored class for you in addition to any other favored class you have or select. For example, a multiclass human fighter/rogue who selects wizard for this feat could add levels of wizard without taking any experience penalty for multiclassing in three classes.

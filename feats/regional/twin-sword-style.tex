\featentry{Twin Sword Style}{[Regional]}

You have mastered a defensive style based on wielding a blade in each hand.

\textbf{Benefit:} When fighting with two blades (dagger, longsword, rapier, scimitar, or short sword, in any combination), you can designate a melee opponent during your action and receive a +2 shield bonus to your Armor Class against attacks from that opponent. This bonus stacks with the shield bonus from a buckler or animated shield. You can select a new melee opponent as a free action on your turn. You lose this bonus if you are caught fl at-footed or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC for any reason.
